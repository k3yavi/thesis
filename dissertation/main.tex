RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies are evolving rapidly, and with them, the requirement 
for fast and accurate tools to analyze the generated data. The first step of many RNA-seq
analyses requires us to solve the problem of \ra. When reads are aligned to a collection of 
reference sequences that share a substantial amount of sub-sequence (near or exact repeats), 
a single read can have many potential alignments, and considering all such alignments can be 
crucial for downstream analyses, such as quantification. This proposal discusses the evolution of 
the tools developed to handle the problem of \ra for next-generation sequencing, their impact 
on RNA-seq analysis, introduces a novel concept, \qm, and an efficient algorithm implementing 
this approach called \rapmap, which maps RNA-seq \reads (sequences) to the reference sequence(s) 
(transcriptome). By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, 
and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, \rapmap is capable of 
\textit{mapping} sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing 
alignment tools. The algorithm we employ to implement \qm uses several efficient data structures 
and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to 
rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information.

Over the last decade, single-cell sequencing technologies have gained popularity and,
while bulk RNA-sequencing is an established method to perform genome-wide quantification of gene 
expressions, quantification tools for bulk RNA-seq cannot be directly used for 
droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) data. We introduce \alevin, a fast 
end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing 
cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, 
gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. \Alevin’s approach to UMI deduplication 
considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and 
accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses 
the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the 
accuracy of gene abundance estimates. \Alevin is considerably faster, typically 8 times  
than existing gene-quantification approaches, while also using less memory.

Finally, we generalize both methods to make them more robust and extend their capabilities. 
While \qm is a useful novel concept, it trades-off some accuracy for speed. In \textit{relatively} complex 
datasets, the loss in accuracy can be significant. We have updated \rapmap to employ alignments to improve 
quantifications in an efficient, dynamic (dataset dependent) way. This optimizes the speed/accuracy tradeoff, 
making the estimates almost as accurate as end-to-end alignment-based methods, while still using resources 
similar to \rapmap. Moreover, we propose a principled approach and study the effect of further extending 
\alevin's framework by optimizing the variational bayesian objective.

My experience as a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook has been life changing as it has helped me 
grow both personally and professionally. A big fraction of that is due to my advisor, 
Rob Patro, whom I'd like to thank for his patience, guidance, and encouragement for letting 
me explore the field of computational biology.
Working with him has been very exciting as he taught me how to do science. His vision 
and tenaciousness to work and improve RNA-seq quantification has helped me learn
how looking at a problem from many different angles can generate exciting new ideas. I also 
feel that his love for statically-typed programmed programming languages has helped me realize 
the importance of designing efficient tools which I hope to keep for the rest of my career.

I'd like to thank other members of my committee, Steve Skiena, Michael Bender and Joshua Rest whose 
important contributions through various lectures, talks, and feedback on this dissertation have 
been pivotal for my academic development while at Stony Brook University. I'm honored to 
have them as my committee members.

I'm very grateful to my colleagues and it was an exciting experience to learn and grow
alongside them over the years. In particular, Laraib Malik, Hirak sarkar, Mohsen Zakeri, and 
Fatemeh Almodaresi made Combine-Lab an interesting place to work as they helped me 
through insightful discussions. I can't imagine working through all the paper deadlines being
an enjoyable and pleasant experience without them. I'd also like to thank Mike Love, 
Charlotte Soneson, Geet Duggal, Richard Smith-Unna, Owen Dando, Darya Filipova, Patrick Marks 
and Paul Ryvkin for their insightful discussions regarding various aspects of the work.

I can't thank my family enough for their support throughout my journey of learning. 
Especially my father, Y K Srivastava, who guided me from my childhood to learn actively and motivated 
me to think out-of-the-box. I'd like to thank my mother Ritima Srivastava, brother Prakhar Srivastava,
late grandparents, Govind Prasad Srivastava, Savitri Srivastava, and all my cousins
for providing a comfortable and loving environment for me while growing up. And finally, 
I'd like to thank my partner, Renu, for constantly reminding me there is more to life than my 
research. Most of all, for standing by my side and providing the much needed emotional support 
throughout the hardships of grad life. 

At last, I would also like to thank Stony Brook Research Computing and 
Cyberinfrastructure, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science at Stony Brook 
University for access to the high-performance SeaWulf computing system, which was made 
possible by a National Science Foundation grant (\#1531492).
